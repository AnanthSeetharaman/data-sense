// This file is now deprecated as primary data source. 
// Data is loaded from /public/db_mock_data/*.csv via csv-data-loader.ts
// Keeping it for now to avoid breaking any minor direct imports if they exist,
// but it should ideally be removed or its contents fully migrated.

// export type DataAsset has been moved to types.ts and adapted.
// export const mockDataAssets is no longer the source of truth.

// The findDataAssetById function is now part of csv-data-loader.ts

// If there's any utility function here not related to mockDataAssets, it should be reviewed.
// For now, this file is largely empty.

export {}; // Add an empty export to ensure it's treated as a module
